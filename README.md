# A_BLT_RPG
A BLT Role Playing Game:

Synopsis:
          
          A text-based Dungeon Crawling RPG made in Python. It employs the use of
          Object Oriented Programming to handle stats of the characters and monsters.
          Careful attention has been paid to balancing the game to make the playing
          experience as pleasurable as possible.

Description:

          In BLT_RPG, you are an adventure raiding a floating castle inhabited by 
          the notorious bandit guild, 'Neko Hooligans'. In the character creation section, 
          you must pick one of five classes: 
          
               i) Berserker ii) Hemomancer iii) Weaponmaster iv) Archmage v) Lone Wolf
          
          With a weapon in hand, your objective is cleave through the Hooligans, ascend
          the three floors of the floating castle and confront the ever-elusive 
          phantom leader of the guild.


Instructions:

          The game is very easy to play. It is text-based and therefore every interaction,
          --whether it is traversing through the dungeon, fighting monsters 
          or checking one's stats-- is done through the use of I/O with Python.
          Play with the window maximized in Python IDLE for the smoothest gaming experience.


Possible Future Updates:

          i) Cleaner Battles; easier to distinguish damage
         ii) The integration of a map to make traversing a bit easier
        iii) The introduction of a GUI
         iv) Integration of a visual/audio aspect
